			<h2>Reflection on Proposal</h2>
			<p>Looking back at the <a href = "proposal.html#mockups">mockups</a> for my website in my web design proposal, I found that I did not provide details about an organization as much as I should be. Also, even though the website I designed seems quite minimal, it was not consistent in design or clear in what information would be put on it, which can be confusing for other users. Therefore, For my final web prototype, I intend to redesign my website again with the new consistent color pallette and design structure mainly for consistency purpose. I also put more details about organization such as the organization main purpose, what campaigns they did, how to contact them, how to get involved and donated, etc. rather than saying what those sections are as in previous assignment.</p>

    <section id="iteration">
      <h2>Iteration</h2>

      <h4><em>Landing Page</em></h4>
        <figure class="img-container">
				<img src="high-fi landing page.png" alt="high-fi landing page" width="100%">
        <figcaption><center>Previous High-fi Landing Page.<center></figcaption>
			</figure>

      <figure class="img-container">
				<img src="landing page prototype 1.png" alt="landing page prototype 1" width="100%">
        <figcaption><center>Landing Page Prototype Top Half.<center></figcaption>
			</figure>

      <figure class="img-container">
				<img src="landing page prototype 2.png" alt="landing page prototype 2" width="100%">
        <figcaption><center>Landing Page Prototype Bottom Half.<center></figcaption>
			</figure>

      <p>I did a lot of changes to the landing page. Firstly, I put the navigation bar at the top right corner instead of in a middle of the page for more useful space. I then briefly explain what an organizatin is about at the left side, so the users would quickly know what this organization is about. There is also a video presentation of an organization in case users are interested to watch it, and below that is a latest campaign of an organization that users can also sign up for it conveniently as well. The color pallette I chose for this web design is different too since I chose blue and yellow as they are complementing each other well. There is a lot more information put on instead of just saying the name of those sections as I did in previous assignment.</p>

      <h4><em>Facts Page</em></h4>
        <figure class="img-container">
				<img src="high-fi learn solar.png" alt="high-fi learn solar page" width="100%">
        <figcaption><center>Previous High-fi Learn Solar Page.<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>

        <figure class="img-container">
				<img src="facts page prototype.png" alt="facts page prototype" width="100%">
        <figcaption><center>Facts Page Prototype.<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>

        <p>For the Facts page, I did change the navigation name from 'Learn Solar' to 'Facts' because I think it has better understanding and also shorter than the previous name. The layout is still quite similar in terms of structure, but I did not put any boxes around the basic info. as I did in the previous version. I believe it looks more comfortable to read than the first version as well. The facts and myths section is put in numbers so that users can read it easily.</p>

      <h4><em>About Page</em></h4>
        <figure class="img-container">
				<img src="high-fi org. info. 1.png" alt="high-fi org. info. page 1" width="100%">
        <figcaption><center>Previous High-fi Org. Info. Page 1.<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>

        <figure class="img-container">
				<img src="high-fi org. info. 2.png" alt="high-fi org. info. page 2" width="100%">
        <figcaption><center>Previous High-fi Org. Info. Page 2.<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>

        <figure class="img-container">
				<img src="about page prototype.png" alt="about page prototype" width="100%">
        <figcaption><center>About Page Prototype.<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>

        <p>I also change the navigation name for this one from 'Organization Info.' to just 'About'. It looks a lot shorter and still serve the same meaning. I change the functioning a little bit here in the anuual report section. Instead of clicking on the year to see the brief info. about the reports, I just write it there and if the users are interested to read the full report, there is a pdf link provided for them to click on as well. The contact info. of an organization is put here too as I did not put it in the previous version.</p>

      <h4><em>Campaigns Page</em></h4>
        <figure class="img-container">
				<img src="high-fi campaigns 1.png" alt="high-fi campaigns page 1" width="100%">
        <figcaption><center>Previous High-fi Campaigns Page 1.<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>

        <figure class="img-container">
				<img src="high-fi campaigns 2.png" alt="high-fi campaigns page 2" width="100%">
        <figcaption><center>Previous High-fi Campaigns Page 2.<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>

        <figure class="img-container">
				<img src="high-fi campaigns 3.png" alt="high-fi campaigns page 3" width="100%">
        <figcaption><center>Previous High-fi Campaigns Page 3.<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>

        <figure class="img-container">
				<img src="campaigns page prototype.png" alt="campaigns page prototype" width="100%">
        <figcaption><center>Campaigns Page Prototype.<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>

        <p>For the Campaigns Page, I completely threw the old design version out and stick to the consistent design as other pages. The reason why I put the upcoming campaigns on the left side instead of the middle that has more space is because there are not as much upcoming campaigns as the past campaigns. Also, the orange color would drew users' eyes to better than the yellow color. Also, if the users are interested in joining the campaign, they can immediately click on the sign up button that will lead them to 'Get Involved' page for more convenient as well. </p>

      <h4><em>Get Involved Page</em></h4>
        <figure class="img-container">
				<img src="high-fi get in touch.png" alt="high-fi get in touch page" width="100%">
        <figcaption><center>Previous High-fi Get in Touch Page.<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>

        <figure class="img-container">
				<img src="getinvolved page prototype.png" alt="get involved page prototype" width="100%">
        <figcaption><center>Get Involved Page Prototype.<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>

        <p>For this page, I did not use the old design version because I think it has too many negative spaces with little info. and also no place for users to type their contact in case they are interested in joining the community. I completely move the thank you quote to the left side and combine the email sign up and become a volunteer as one since they are the same process anyway (users would need to fill their info. first to become a volunteer). I did add the checkbox here too so that users can choose by themselves to recieve updated emails about organization or not. There is also a link to the support us page (donation) at the bottom too.</p>

      <h4><em>Support Us Page</em></h4>
        <figure class="img-container">
				<img src="high-fi support us 1.png" alt="high-fi support us page 1" width="100%">
        <figcaption><center>Previous High-fi Support Us Page 1.<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>
        
        <figure class="img-container">
				<img src="high-fi support us 2.png" alt="high-fi support us page 2" width="100%">
        <figcaption><center>Previous High-fi Support Us Page 2.<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>

        <figure class="img-container">
				<img src="supportus page prototype 1.png" alt="support us page prototype 1" width="100%">
        <figcaption><center>Support Us Page Prototype Top Half.<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>

        <figure class="img-container">
				<img src="supportus page prototype 2.png" alt="support us page prototype 2" width="100%">
        <figcaption><center>Support Us Page Prototype Bottom Half.<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>

        <p>For the Support Us page, I kept the name lists of supporters from the previous design but also add the thank you quote to the bottom instead of the top right corner as in the previous version because I think it is the place that users can see the quote better and it seems more sincere too in my opinion. The three types of donations are still the same but in a different layout. I found that the old version design has too little space to write or put any picture in it, so I took it out and just simply writing those three options down. The see more details buttons are added to each options in case users want to know more about them. For the one-time donation and regular (monthly) supporter options, after the users finish writing down their info. and click on the continue button, it would lead them to the payment page, which they can put their credit card info. like the card holder name, card number, expiration date, and CVV on to avoid the messiness design in this page.</p>
