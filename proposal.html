			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p><strong>Solar Citizens</strong> is an independent, community-based organization that brings millions of solar owners and supporters together to take the next step and keep growing Australian renewable energy. From the power of people movement who stands for the rights of solar owners and sensible clean energy policies, Solar Citizens has achieved victories for many times in terms of government policies (Solar Citizens, n.d.).</p>

			<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
			<p>Solar power is energy created by the heat and light from the sun, which can convert into electricity in order to heat
				the air, water, or to create solar fuels like hydrogen. At the moment, there are two types of solar power technology:
				Solar photovoltaic, and Solar thermal.</p>

			<p><strong>Solar photovoltaic</strong> converts sunlight directly through semiconductor cell or solar PV cell. Solar PV panels are currently the most popular type of solar energy.</p>

      <p><strong>Solar thermal</strong> converts sunlight into heat and can be used to various purposes such as creating steam to make electricity or used to drive refrigeration cycle with solar-based cooling (Australian Renewable Energy Agency, 2020).</p>

      <p>Australian continent has highest solar energy resources per square meter more than any other countries in the world. Australia receives an average of 58 million PJ (petajoule) of solar radiation per year, which is around 10,000 times larger than its total energy consumption (Geoscience Australia, n.d.).</p>

      <p>In 2016 - 17, Solar PV generated 3.1% of Australia’s electricity with more than two million of Australian households (21%) that have rooftop solar PV installed (Australian Renewable Energy Agency, 2020).</p>

      <p>In 2019, small-scale solar PV was generated 22.3% of total clean energy and produced 5.3% of Australia’s total electricity. There were 287,504 rooftop solar installations, and more than 2.5 million Australian households are using benefits of rooftop solar right now (Clean Energy Council, n.d.).</p>

      <p>While electricity prices have been continued to skyrocket, solar panel has become more affordable with the price falling more than 75% since 2009, and 500 times cheaper that the first solar cells produced in mid-1950s. Although there were less than 100,000 households installed with solar panel in 2008, there were more than two million rooftops solar installed in the last decade making Australia a number one in the world when it comes to rooftop solar. This fact makes the future of solar energy in Australia looking very bright and strong (Solar Citizens, n.d.).</p>
			
			<h3 id="profiles">User Profiles</h3>
			<p>The target users for this website would be Australian citizens who are interested to use solar power by installing solar PV on their rooftop for a cheaper electricity cost in the long run. Also, those who want to support the idea of using clean renewable energy in Australia especially citizens who live in South Australia, Northern Territory, and Tasmania area because according to reseach these areas are not having much solar PV installations yet compare to other states such as New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory, Victoria, Queensland, and Western Australia (Solar Feeds, 2019).</p>
			<!-- Use the blockquote element if applicable -->
			<blockquote>
				The website needs to give information about what is solar power and how it can help them saving electricity cost in the long run and nation as a whole. Also, it should be designed for users to navigate freely and make them want to support the organization either by volunteering or donation.

			<h2>Ideation</h2>
			<p>To design the website for Solar Citizens organization, there are three stages of iterations taking place.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>1st iteration</strong> is a rough idea of the website showing from landing page to navigation bars and where it leads to.</li>
				<li><strong>2nd iteration</strong> is a self-review of the first iteration to see what works, what needs to change or add.</li>
				<li><strong>3rd iteration</strong> is the final plan for the website showing from landing page to navigation bars and all the pages it would lead users to.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 id="moodboards">Mood Boards</h3>
			  <figure class="img-container">
					<img src="first iteration.png" alt="1st iteration" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>1st Iteration.<center></figcaption>
				</figure>

        <p>This is an initial idea of how the website would have in the final prototype. At this stage, there are total of four navigation bars: Learn about Solar Power, Organization Info., Past Campaigns, and Donation.</p>

        <figure class="img-container">
					<img src="second iteration.png" alt="2nd iteration" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>2nd Iteration.<center></figcaption>
				</figure>

        <p>For the second iteration, I did self-review and decided to add and change quite many things to make the website more usable and complete. At this stage, I decided to add another navigation bar for users who want to receive information about organization or only doing volunteer work but do not want to donate, or support the organization with money. What's written in red are things that I add or change from the first iteration.</p>

        <figure class="img-container">
					<img src="third iteration.png" alt="3rd iteration"width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>3rd Iteration.<center></figcaption>
				</figure>

        <p>The third iteration page showing the full picture of what the navagation bars are and where it would take users to clearly. There are still some elements that I add or arrange it. For example, basic info. about Solar Power and Contact info. of organization.</p>

        <figure class="img-container">
					<img src="Sitemap.png" alt="Sitemap" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>Sitemap<center></figcaption>
				</figure>

        <p>Here is the sitemap showing what navigation bars the users can interact with.</p>

        <figure class="img-container">
					<img src="final sitemap.png" alt="Final sitemap" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>Final Sitemap<center></figcaption>
				</figure>

        <p>This is the full version of sitemap for the website showing the landing page, navigation bars, where and what pages it would take users to. Also, the informatin hierachy and how they are linked to each other.</p>

			<h3 id="sketches">Sketches</h3>
			<p>After knowing what would be on my website, I started the designing process by skectching multiple of the landing page and other navigations. </p>

      <br>
      <h4><em>Landing Page</em></h4>

        <figure class="img-container">
					<img src="4 sketches landing page.png" alt="sketches of landing page" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>4 Sketches of Landing Page<center></figcaption>
				</figure>

        <p>Here are the sketches of the <strong>Landing Page</strong> that I designed. I reviewd each of them about what elements I like, do not like, or what I can refine more out of it. Then, I take all those considerations to make the final sketch of the landing page.</p>

        <figure class="img-container">
					<img src="landing page final sketch.png" alt="final sketch of landing page" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>Final Sketch of Landing Page<center></figcaption>
				</figure>

        <p>As a result, my <strong>Final Sketch of Landing Page</strong> would be a walkthrough website, which also give users freedom to navigate by themselves in any order. The design is inspired from the sun and renewable energy cycle picture.</p>

        <br>
        <h4><em>Learn about Solar Power Page</em></h4>

        <figure class="img-container">
					<img src="3 sketches of learn solar.png" alt="3 sketches of learn solar" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>3 Sketches of Learn about Solar Power Page<center></figcaption>
				</figure>

        <p>For the <strong>Learn about Solar Power Page</strong>, I did three sketches and took the design elements I like from each one to the final sketch.</p>

        <figure class="img-container">
					<img src="learn solar final sketch.png" alt="Final sketch of learn solar" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>Final Sketch of Learn about Solar Power Page<center></figcaption>
				</figure>

        <p>In the end, I took the design from the 3rd sketch and combine it with the 1st sketch layout resulting in a <strong>Final Sketch of Learn about Solar Power Page</strong>. There are two buttons that I add for users to click on. First is a button to go back to the landing page and another one is to go to the next navigation page button.</p>

        <br>
        <h4><em>Organization Info. Page</em></h4>

        <figure class="img-container">
					<img src="4 sketches of org. info..PNG" alt="org. info. sketches" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>4 Sketches of Org. Info. Page<center></figcaption>
				</figure>

        <p>There are four sketches I did for an <strong>Organization Info. Page</strong>. It was quite challenging for me to design this page because I think most of my sketches end up too minimalistic. However, in the end, I decided to put things together in a balanced manners that I am satisfied with.</p>

        <figure class="img-container">
					<img src="org. info. final sketch.PNG" alt="Final sitemap" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>Final Sketch of Organization Info. Page<center></figcaption>
				</figure>

        <p>This <strong>Final Sketch of Organization Info. Page</strong> would mainly rely on the clicking to see the information inside. By clicking the years, the box would show up a brief summary of the year and the annual reports that users can click again to download it. This annual report is necessary for credibility purpose of the organization.</p>

        <br>
        <h4><em>Campaigns Page</em></h4>

        <figure class="img-container">
					<img src="3 sketches of campaigns.png" alt="campaignes sketches" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>3 Sketches of Campaigns Page<center></figcaption>
				</figure>

        <p>Out of the three sketches for <strong>Campaigns Page</strong>, the first sketch seems quite weak in the design part in my opinion. I actually quite like the 3rd design, but the problem with it is that it takes too much space on the webpage. Therefore, I choose to mainly focus on refining the 2nd sketch.</p>

        <figure class="img-container">
					<img src="campaigns final sketch.png" alt="Final campaigns sketch" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>Final Sketch of Campaigns Page<center></figcaption>
				</figure>

        <p>After doing some refining on the 2nd sketch, there are design elements that I decided to add to the <strong>Final Sketch of Campaigns Page</strong> such as</p> 
        <ul>
        <li>The arrow representing the beginning to the future ahead</li>
        <li>using different colors for past, current, and upcoming for easier visual.</li>
        <li>More clicking interactive, when the users click on the date, numbers of campaigns will show up. After clicking the name of the campaigns, little box will pop up and let the users read the brief explanation of the campaigns.</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <h4><em>Get in Touch Page</em></h4>

        <figure class="img-container">
					<img src="3 sketches of get in touch.png" alt="get in touch sketches" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>3 Sketches of Get in Touch Page<center></figcaption>
				</figure>

        <p>From these three sketches of <strong>Get in Touch Page</strong> I decided to do more refining on the second and the third sketches because I really like the balance of putting information on two sides of the webpage, and the idea of connection in the visual design part.</p>

        <figure class="img-container">
					<img src="get in touch final sketch.png" alt="Final sketch of get in touch" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>Final Sketch of Get in Touch Page<center></figcaption>
				</figure>

        <p>Taking the design elements that I like from the previous two sketches, the <strong>Final Sketch of Get in Touch Page</strong> is visually presents by the handshake picture. One hand is the users and another hand represents the Solar Citizens Organization. Because there is not much information to put in this get in touch page, there are spaces left for other things like thank you quote and freely imagination about the design part making this navigation page more interesting and fun.</p>

        <br>
        <h4><em>Support Us Page</em></h4>

        <figure class="img-container">
					<img src="3 sketches of support us.png" alt="support us sketches" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>3 Sketches of Support Us Page<center></figcaption>
				</figure>

        <p>All these three sketches looks too structured in my opinion. However, there are some elements that I like in the 2nd and 3rd sketches of <strong>Support Us Page</strong>, which are the name lists of supporters, and the round shape design. Therefore, I would take these into consideratoin when refining the final sketch.</p>

        <figure class="img-container">
					<img src="support us final sketch.png" alt="Final sketch of support us page" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>Final Sketch of Support Us Page<center></figcaption>
				</figure>

        </p>The <strong>Final Sketch of Support Us Page</strong> after refining looks less structured, the round shape represents the coins since this page is about supporting the organization with money. There are some spaces left for a playful design, thank you quote and  the name lists of supporters showing as well.</p>
